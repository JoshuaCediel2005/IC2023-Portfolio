I am intrested in majoring in Aerospace Engineer and minoring in Computer Engineering. I have interned with Nextech Catapult to pursue my intrest in computer engineering and have created this website with the knowledge that I have learned from this experience.</p>

            <p class="text_earth">The second website I created through Nextech was a highschool class choice simulator that was intended to represent the different side effects of what classes you decide to take in highschool and how they will effect you in the long run. I wished I had more guidance when deciding what classes to take and I hope that after improving my website I can see if schools can implement this website for incoming freshman.</p>

            <p class="text_mars">The third website I created was a sports quiz intended to help questioning students determine what sports they should try out for based on their intrest and characteristics. Hopefully this will help more students find sports that they can learn and enjoy so that students stay in shape and exercise regularly.</p>

I have taken advanced math, science, and PLTW courses at my school and am sure that Aerospace Engineering and Computer Engineering are the right courses that I want to pursue. I want to go to Purdue in order to pursue these dreams because growing up in Lafayette as a child and experience campus visits I can't see myself going anywhere else.</p>
